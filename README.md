appdotnet
=========

A wrapper for the App.net HTTP Stream API, following node idioms. See https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec for a API description.



Current State
-------------

app.net's api is not yet stable and so is this package. There's no generated documentation for this right now, so be sure to checkout the examples/ directory.

Until now, we only support a tiny part of the api, just look at the code to see which ones.



API Overview
------------

 * AppDotNet.createAuthenticationUri(…)
 * AppDotNet.requestAccessToken(…)



Developers
----------

There will be some unit tests in the future. To use and test this module, you have to register an application on app.net.
